**Snapmaker Luban / Snapmakerjs(Old version)**

If you want to do some simple job. You can use any svg editor(Like Inkscrape or Adobe illustrator) to do the design, then export .svg file. Using SnapmakerLuban to generate the gcode. 

Snapmakerjs also support relief for small landscape. 


Generate gcode using Snapmakerjs 

   * https://support.snapmaker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041252474-CNC-Carving
   * Using svg editor like Inkscrape or other software to export .svg file, then import into Snapmakerjs.
   * Notice that, .dxf is a format that working on to let Snapmakerjs read .dxf file. For now, you can use other tools like https://cloudconvert.com/dxf-to-svg or alternative to help to do the job if your CAD software canâ€™t export .svg format. 


**Fusion360**

We can achieve serious task by using it. 

Generate gcode using Fusion 360

   * We have developed post processor script for Fusion 360 to help more advanced use case. 
   * The reason we favor Fusion 360 is that it has free license for education.




##  Support software status overview 

| Software        | Status           |  link |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Snapmaker Luban| Stable | | 
| Fusion 360     | Testing | |
| FreeCAD    | TODO     |   |
| ArtCAM|TODO||
| Mastercam | TODO      |  |
| Aspire |TODO ||



## Gcode 

Similar with Fusion 360, it need a few development effort to create post process script for different CAD platform. These scripts are responsible for convert 3D trajectory(representation)  into concrete Gcode dialects.  There are Gcode dialect difference between firmwares(Vendors).

We can refer to [Gcode Reference](./gcode_reference.md) to build post for spefifc software. 


## Summary

The documentation is still under active development.
